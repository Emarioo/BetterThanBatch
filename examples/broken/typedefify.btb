/* 
    Note: The simple code worked on the second attempt.
     The reason it didn't work first try is because I wrote
     mode == FIND_STRUCT instead of mode = FIND_STRUCT.
     I may have been lucky, I may have created the language
     so I just know what to do but I also believe the
     language is fairly easy to code in.
     (I have a bias of course)
