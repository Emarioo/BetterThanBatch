I am not updating this right now since it's mostly users of the language that benefit from a changelog. Since there are no users (except for me), it seems like wasted effort to work on a changelog. However, at some point in the future (when the language is used bu people other than me) I will go through all features of the compiler, test them, document them, and from there keep the changelog updated with changes.

<!-- All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Every version will not have a release on github but every version that does, will be marked. -->
 
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project **DOES NOT** adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). At least not versions below **1.0.0**.
