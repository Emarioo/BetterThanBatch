**DISCLAIMER:** Incomplete chapter.

**TODO:** Should this text be in this chapter or in a chapter about the standard library? There may be a lot to say about platform specific programming and bindings?

# Platforms
The standard library provides some bindings for Windows and Linux but it is recommended to use the platform independent part of the standard library if possible.

## Windows
- Functions for HeapAlloc, CreateFile...

## Linux
- Bindings for basic syscalls: read, open, getrandom, getdents, mmap, and a few more.
- Some structures for those syscalls: stat, linux_dirent64.
- Some macros for flags to syscalls.

**TODO:** What more to say?
