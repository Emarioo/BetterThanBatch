Chapter 100 and above is designated for informations and guides for the standard library. These guides are aimed at helping you find what you are looking for. They are not meant to explain every detail about those libraries, for details, see the comments in the actual code.

**NOTE**: Most libraries are work in progress and bound to change. That is why documentation is missing.
